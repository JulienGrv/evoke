# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is built around folders with some tool that builds it - a perfect fit for Evoke. As an example, you can take the file provided in the Evoke repository under `.vscode/tasks.json` which tells VSCode to interpret your folder as an Evoke project. It then functions completely and allows you to edit the code as you please.

# To include in your project

Copy the file `.vscode/tasks.json` to your own project with the exact same name, and then open the project folder in VSCode.
